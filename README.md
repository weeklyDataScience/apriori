# Apriori Algorithm Challenge
Hey y'all!

I originally kicked this off as an open challenge to analyze the datasets included here. (Read the original challenge [here](https://medium.com/weekly-data-science/retail-analysis-challenge-bcd2d1ca1e82))

Since then, I've decided to make the challenge a bit more strucutred. I wrote a blog post on the intuition behind the Apriori Algorithm, where I challenged readers to implement the algorithm themselves.

Here, I'm providing datasets that may be useful as you implement the algorithm. I've also included `dataset_builder.py`, which you can use to generate very large datasets and test your implementation "at scale". (You'll be running these on your own machine, most likely - so you won't be doing anything at petabyte scale. But hey - it's still fun.)

The hand-drawn mini dataset from the blog post is `blog-baskets.txt`; `baskets.txt` and `other-baskets.txt` are two other datasets that I encourage you to use.

## Wanna share your results?
Personally, I think this kind of thing is more fun when you engage with others. If you'd like to share your implementation with me - or give me any feedback you have on this - please reach out! My contact info is below.

And if you want to engage with others with an interest in Data Science - as well as hear about these projects as I'm creating them, [join my mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dxKiQ9). I send out a weekly email with some Data Science related content each week.
